  mission-title: Our Mission
  mission: The Ottawa Pops Orchestra aims to foster the next generation of musicians, redefine the orchestral experience, and create a sense of community in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region.
  about:
    one: We are a semi-professional community orchestra dedicated to performing accessible and relevant music. The “Pops” in our name is short for “popular” as the music we play is sourced from current popular culture, telling stories from once upon a time in galaxies far, far away. That said, we also like to keep one foot in the world of classical music – its traditions, its rich history, and especially its romance.
    two: We combine our passions by performing innovative concerts that redefine the modern orchestral experience. We’re made of people just like you, and we love to dress up and share our love for the music we play. Our mission - to foster the next generation of musicians, redefine the orchestral experience, and create a sense of community in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region.
    three: We have humble roots as a school club at the University of Ottawa, founded by Mathieu Roy in 2012 with only a handful of eager musicians. We have since incorporated as a Non Profit Organization and boast 65 musicians.
    four: Our first season in 2017-2018 was a huge success, as we performed for over 3000 people over the course of three series of concerts. In the 2018-2019 season, our performances are hosted exclusively at Meridian Theatres at Centrepointe as we develop educational opportunities in the Ottawa area and bring bigger and better shows to life than ever before.

about-us:
  title: Learn about the Ottawa Pops Orchestra
  one: The Ottawa Pops Orchestra is a community orchestra dedicated to programming orchestral pops repertoire in order to enrich and inspire the community through accessible, relevant, and passionate performances.
  two: Founded in the spring of 2017 by a collective of young musicians, Ottawa Pops Orchestra (OPO) strives to bridge classical orchestral repertoire with popular music, curating innovative concerts that redefine the orchestral experience for today’s audience. Under the joint direction of Matthew Larkin and Jonathan Dagenais, OPO strives to inspire, engage, and educate the greater Ottawa/Gatineau area.
  three: OPO is proud to announce two new educational initiatives for young musicians and students in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region. We are inviting local schools to some of our dress rehearsals and providing detailed educational resources for those shows to teachers, allowing students to experience a live orchestra in action. This season, we are also proud to offer the Orchestral Development Bursary, which provides the opportunity for young, talented musicians to refine their skill and gain professional orchestral experience with OPO.

season:
  covid: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to postpone the 2020-21 season announcement to a later time. More information to come.

    p1: "The Ottawa Pops Orchestra’s Stories Through Music Series engages different members of our community who will be sharing a playlist of their favourite songs and telling a story about why this music is so important to them.

    fastFacts:
      title: "Fast Facts about Twin Flames"
      f1: "Twin Flames is an award-winning husband-and-wife duo made up of Jaaji and Chelsey June. They sing songs in English, Inuttitut and French. "
      f2: "Jaaji is Inuk and Mohawk from Nunavik, and Chelsey June is Métis (Algonquin Cree) from Ottawa."
      f3: "Twin Flames push the boundaries of “Contemporary Folk”, with songs that incorporate both Western and traditional instruments. "
      f4: "2016 and 2017 winners of The Canadian Folk Music Award; Aboriginal Songwriters of the Year. "
      f5: " Human hit #1 on indigenous music charts, CBC’s Music Class, and was the UNESCO feature song to celebrate indigenous languages around the world"
      f6: "This piece has been translated into 500 languages across the world."
      f7: "Twin Flames is working on a brand-new album called Omen, which will be released this August."
    q1:
      q: "Why did you choose these songs? Is there a greater, unifying context to the playlist? "
      a_1: "Chelsey: “Definitely. All of the songs we chose are ones that influenced our life, our music writing and our musical career. The playlist is pretty much a walkthrough of how Twin Flames was born from the very beginning. We first met in 2014 on the television series, TAM (Talent Autochthones Musicaux), and our instant connection through music. Neither of us were supposed to be there on set, but with Jaaji’s last minute tour schedule change and me getting there through a cancellation, we ended up there on the same day.” "
      a_2: "Jaaji: “Everyone was singing around the fire the night before filming, and Chelsey started jamming with me on one of my cover songs. When our voices met in harmony, everyone noticed how much we clicked through song. Usually, harmonizing is something you practice and learn with your band, but this was instantaneous. Having grown up with the great harmonies of yesterday in my ear, it was a very impacting moment between us and where it all began.” "
    q2:
      q: "How have these songs/pieces impacted you? "
      a_1: "Chelsey: “All of these pieces tie into our life and how we were feeling at the time, so it’s kind of a journey through our life experiences. It’s hard to choose, but there are a few special pieces that stand out. Yellow by Coldplay, influenced both of us deeply. I remember being so in awe of the sounds in the song.” "
      a_2: "Jaaji: “I totally agree. The piece is acoustic and simple, but still so full of nuance. It’s simple but incredibly inspiring at the same time.” "
      a_3: "Chelsey: “A lot of my musical influences come from my subconscious, and my parents were both obsessed with music. I vividly remember listening Leaving on a Jet Plane by Peter, Paul and Mary, sitting on the floor with those huge 80s headphones. Music was a different level of love for me, I grew up in a household as an only child, watching a difficult relationship between my parents. Music was an escape for me for sure. I learned that love of music and using it as a coping mechanism from both parents. I remember my mom blasting Coming Around Again by Carly Simon, which talks about marriage and babies and how hard it can get on a relationship when the couple is no longer the focus. I loved the melody of the song as a child, the lyrics are really impacting now because I understand them as an adult and can see my own past through them. It was so fun to do this exercise, to dig down and realize what we think about this music and how it impacted us.” "
      a_4: "Jaaji: “For me, being from an era when CDs were just coming out, I remember my stepdad was the first guy to get a CD player way up north, and it was a big deal. I grew up listening to all the folk greats like Simon and Garfunkel, but I was often listening to the cover versions from alternative rock bands. Honestly, it was a bit of an emotional can of worms opening up, looking back at the past and listening to this music and then seeing/feeling how it influenced the writing we have now with our pieces. Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours was a big one. It’s really cool to see the musical influences on our new album which is coming out in August.”  "
      a_5: "Chelsey: “This music is definitely personal to us. Especially the pieces that we wrote or Jaaji wrote before Twin Flames. Nunaga was the first song I heard Jaaji singing on the set for TAM. I didn’t understand the language but I was totally captivated by it. So much so that I would drive to work listening to that song on the CD he gave me. It’s really special that we now sing it together.” "
      a_6: "Jaaji: “Ya, this piece has become an anthem for the north. I wrote it in 2012 during a dark time when my son had been hospitalized due to an accident. I remember sitting at my then home in Montreal and desperately wanting to go back home where I grew up, way up north in the Arctic, back to my innocence and youth. Suddenly, I saw these snowflakes falling outside like they did during my childhood, and I hadn’t seen any snowflakes that size anywhere else but my hometown of Quaqtaq. I got nostalgic, picked up my mandolin, went to washroom and created Nunaga. Lots of art happens in the washroom, to be honest. But I sang from my heart, I hit record on my cell phone and just sang it - not a single part of the lyrics or the melody ever changed. People love this song for its relatability and nostalgia. We’ve once played it eight times in one night.” "
      a_7: "Chelsey: “Another piece that we created together on this playlist is Whispers in the Dark. Before we performed together, I was working a government job and was so unhappy. Jaaji finally convinced me to come on tour with him, but I was scared of performing, of planes… of my own shadow. I pushed past that fear and joined him touring for the summer of 2015, exclusively touring through the Arctic. It wasn’t instantly perfect by any means. I was dealing with social anxiety and the reception to me, as a white-looking indigenous woman that no one knew, onstage with Jaaji, who was already well known, it was tough. People didn’t want me up there at first. So, when I got home to Ottawa, Jaaji and I wrote this call-and-answer style piece, Whispers in the Dark, which is all about how neither of us are alone because we have each other.” "
      a_8: "Jaaji: “It’s also a huge testament to Chelsey and her huge heart that she continued to sing and hung in there. She kept pushing through her sadness of not being wanted and eventually the reception shifted to love. She is now known as the ‘in-law to the north’ which is Ukuaq in Inuttutit. I loved growing Twin Flames with her. Even in the beginning, Chelsey had this playlist that was different to what I normally listened to. She loved The Civil Wars and they sounded like they were a couple. Their song Dust to Dust had lyrics that fit like, ‘let me hold your hand, we can dance around the flame / you’re like a mirror reflecting me, takes one to know one so take it from me’  It was great to think we could share this dream together, too.” "
      a_9: "Chelsey: “Sharing the dream together always makes us reflect and say, as if we get to live this, as if we are lucky enough to experience this together from onstage to recording, and travelling the world doing what we love most - music! We have experienced some amazing moments with fellow artists too and have shared the stage with so many incredible artists. We have Chosen by Rose Cousins on our playlist because we met her in summer 2018 during on Canada C3 expedition. We were chosen by Parks Canada to perform at Base Camp in the Torngat Mountains. The first time we heard her sing on the ship we felt transported, and I felt that every word of her song “chosen” were for me. I got to meet her again at the Edmonton folk festival, and she brought me during her set to sing with her. Jaaji is all about the melody but I find I am more drawn to lyrics.” "
      a_10: "Jaaji: “I definitely connect with the melody but there are lyrics that really hit home for me, too. Porchlight from our first debut album was never supposed to be ‘out there’. It was really a song for us to cope with the issues around the missing and murdered indigenous women of Canada and then the song just became so important to us and our audience.” "
      a_11: "Chelsey: “For me, as a Métis I do not belong to a reserve and while I was told as a child to be proud of my Métis culture, I didn’t know what that meant. My grandmother was even told when she was young to be afraid to talk about her Métis background because of the racism that existed in her small town. Rediscovering my culture through my adolescence and adult life has been so important. The movie called Trouble in the Garden has “Plane Song” featured in the closing scene and most people will ask for this piece because it helps them feel proud. We want to keep that going.” "
    q3:
      q: "What story does your music tell and what do you want it to make people feel? "
      a_1: "Chelsey: “We want our music to help audiences within communities to feel proud and know that they have a voice in this world. As an Indigenous woman, I want to use my voice to bring about change and understanding in non-indigenous communities. We want to make the conversation around reconciliation and understanding accessible. We don’t want people to feel guilty or that they need to apologize, but we want to open their hearts and minds. It is very important to us to sing songs in Indigenous languages, and to give non-indigenous people a deeper understanding of us - Twin Flames, and Indigenous people’s history, because a lot has been left out of Canadian history. Our main message is that the world needs a lot more love and this is always at the forefront of our music and our message. Music is the soundtrack of our entire lives, and we’re just so glad people are listening, especially our youth and making us part of their soundtrack.” "
      a_2: "Jaaji: “Absolutely. Our hope is always that maybe they’ll turn on the song and realize that they can do anything with their lives and that nothing is impossible. The outlets are there, music, sports, poetry, hunting. We just want to encourage our listeners to follow their dreams. I became a cop when I got out of high school because I needed to support my child. I never thought I would be a musician, but it happened. But, in our communities and our world, there is a huge need to encourage people to follow their dreams, especially our youth. I have a younger brother and many friends that have committed suicide, and we are desperate for this epidemic to stop and for our youth to see how much they can accomplish. We get mail from fans saying ‘your song saved my life, I was ready to go but there was a kid outside the shed playing one of your songs, and I didn’t follow through’. Getting that kind of a message gives us so much sadness but also hope to keep writing and making small differences in people’s lives. We never know when that song will be there for someone. We’ve gotten messages from people saying thank you for the music, but they can’t go on living. One life lost is too many, so we are here to tell people they matter and to not give up on their dreams.” "
      a_3: "Chelsey: “I remember my own feelings of singing alone and only to myself. At 26, I finally decided to try song writing, just for me. And then when I started making an album, I was only doing it to show my children that they could do anything they wanted, ‘if mommy can do it, you guys can do it’. From doing my first recording session, where I had to face away from the tech team because I was so nervous, to finally being onstage and seeing the audience sing my own songs back with me, it has been surreal. When I realized I could connect with people and share my voice with them it was pure magic. Having Jaaji onstage was that extra security blanket, and a wonderful team of musicians and an incredible producer… We’ve just been so lucky. And we want to use that to show people that they can follow and work for their dreams, too.” "
    q4:
      q: "Is there a message you want to convey to your readers/listeners? "
      a_1: "Jaaji: “A lot of people pay too much attention to what they should or shouldn’t be listening to instead of making their own choice. We’ve all grown up with all kinds of music in those cd rack card holders and it’s okay to like what you like! I don’t ever expect anyone to like our music, if they don’t, good for the next band that they do like. It’s okay to love what you love; music is so important and deserves to be something to enjoy and escape to.” "
      a_2: "Chelsey: “To anyone who discovers our music for the first time, we hope that they listen with an open heart, and want to learn more about our stories… not just ours but the whole history of our people. Also, take away that dreams do come true and you can work for your dreams. One dream we are still shooting for is to be featured on a commercial radio singing in English and Inuttitut. We know there is space for it here in Canada.” "
      a_3: "Both: “And finally, that art is important! Everyone has been listening to music and watching shows created and recorded by artists. Music isn’t non-essential. We have so many big corporations asking us to play for free or for ‘exposure’, it doesn’t make sense that we are ‘essential’ to making their company meeting or fundraiser a success, but we are considered non-essential when it comes to earning money. Art is so important, so keep listening, watching and supporting the artists you love!”  "

    article:
      p1: "This is a story ostensibly about not drawing bold lines between the multiplicity of one’s passions. But if you look deeper, it’s really about letting yourself be who you already are. "
      p2: "Today if asked what I am, I will offer that I’m a professor at the University of Ottawa, an Epidemiologist. But in addition to being a professional scientist, I’ve also had some success as a writer of both fiction and nonfiction, have dabbled in acting, am obsessed with world history and mythology, and maintain an unrepentant fascination with all things unprovable and possibly even spiritual."
      p3: "But am I not more than that? Am I not a son, brother, husband, and father? How about a learner? A consumer? A polluter? A seeker? And more? It is, of course, an ancient question.  "
      p4: "I started out as a poor immigrant kid from South America, rich in love and family, but bereft of well-educated role models equipped to guide me through the labyrinths of choice and identity. Absent such guidance, one defaults to the path laid out by the unconscious economy: let your labour give rise to your identity. Let your sense of self be defined by your mercantile value. Become an occupation. "
      p5: "Mine is not a unique story. The multiplicity of identity is ubiquitous yet rarely discussed openly. You and I and everyone else are indeed complex creatures with multifold interests. It is unfair to be described as solely one’s profession, or even as the sum of one’s relationships. Identity transcends the measurable and insists on sustained obscurity and fluidity across time.  "
      p6: "Yet we often retreat to the laziness and simplicity of labels by occupation --roles in the measurable universe of economic weight and production. We are complicit in this reduction, allowing the machine to shape us into fitting the mold. It is indeed the unnaturalness of the modern world that compels us to choose a single path, a single convenient role, and to have that role define our identities.  "
      p7: "It wasn’t until I watched Carl Sagan’s “Cosmos”, with its celestial soundtrack by Vangelis, that I deeply understood that we could choose more. My family would gather in front of our old black and white TV every Sunday night to watch the PBS broadcast from across Lake Ontario. As the youngest, it commonly fell to me to delicately maneuver the UHF dial into just the right precarious position to receive a clear signal. I will never forget how my jaw fell to the floor as I watched Dr Sagan weave empirical observation with personal value, art with history, ancient with modern, all the while miraculously balancing the vastness of a cosmic perspective with the intimacy of his personal journey. "
      p8: "Even as a child, it quickly dawned on me that this was the struggle of all thinking people, regardless of education, standing, or social class. Scientists, artists, nurses, construction workers, priests, teachers, schoolchildren, lovers, warriors, innkeepers: all are seeking meaning. All are struggling to simply contextualize their existence within the hugeness of everything else. Whether or not they use these particular words, and regardless of whether any theism forms a foundation in their lives, all are essentially seeking the divine in their actions.  "
      p9: "So it was clear that I could be both a scientist and an artist, or neither and both simultaneously. I could be an empiricist who has no conflict with people of faith. I could be comfortable in masculinity and not see conflict with femininity. I could live in the technological present but dream hazily of the ancient past. I could speak of molecules and soul in the same breath. It really didn’t matter because roles and labels were just tools to help formulate understanding.  "
      p10: "Driving that penetrating realization was Vangelis’s haunting electronic score, elevating Sagan’s casual profundity to Vedic timelessness. The music still cements the memories of those heady days of intellectual awakening within a foundation of emotion. Art and science and education conspired to embrace and enthrall, and the result was synthetic beauty and feeds and delights me to this day. "
      p11: "That is one of the many powers of music: to coalesce and solidify feeling and sentiment into the parallel reality of memory space. I listen to a song and it brings me back to what I was doing and feeling when that sound was first imprinted. Playlists are therefore personal and ultimately inaccessible by others, since they recount an emotional voyage that is subjective by its very nature. The reading of a good book, the first flowering of romantic love, the creep of perfidious injustice, or an intellectual awakening: all are encoded into the DNA of our individual musical ontogenies.

      p2: "The first RRHOF stop after the cashier is an introductory video. A short movie started with footage of a train. Along with the sound of those big wheels turning we could hear field songs and snippets of gospel and yodeling. The montage kept returning to the train. We were wondering: what’s that train? Where is that train going? Voices began to be accompanied with instruments: guitars and banjos and pianos. The train kept coming and the music became at once bluesy and folksy. Those two styles kept being juxtapositioned over the sound of the rails, faster and more polished and then electric and then Elvis’ voice over it all: “trainnntrainnnnnnn, trainnnnnn, coming round the bend,” and I leaned over to Nick and Nat and I said “I know what train is! That train is Rock and Roll!” "
      p3: "I apologize for ruining the surprise about the train. "
      p4: "A day later we were off to visit Memphis and Nashville. My son was a budding musician at that point, playing the piano and guitar. We thought we’d introduce him to some of our favourite music and see some sights. We stood on the Ryman Auditorium stage, visited Sun Records, took in as much of Beale Street as you can with a kid in tow, toured RCA Studio B and Stax, enjoyed the weirdness of Graceland and took in a show at the modern Grand Ole Opry. It was delightful. Even as he became a serious student of jazz (for which we later toured New Orleans), he’s maintained an appreciation for those rock and roll country and blues roots. "
      p5: "It seems in many ways, today, that music is ubiquitous and increasingly divorced from geography. Accompanying these written pieces from various Ottawans are playlists that Ottawa Pops has asked us to curate. We can listen to those from virtually anywhere in the world. Yet, when we visit other places like the cities above or Vienna or Berlin or Chicago or Seattle or Havana, we know instinctively that those are music cities. They’ve become identified with a genre or musical innovation that has changed what we listen to. They’re often home to some critical mass of musicians who are creating and fusing and inventing something new. Most importantly, they’re playing it for themselves and others in small halls and bars and in classrooms. "
      p6: "The cool thing about music cities is that you don’t have to be a musician to enjoy them. As the 70s turned into the 80s on the Sunset Strip, the fans flocking to the Roxy to see Motley Crue weren’t shredding guitarists and savage drummers. They were students and bankers and retail workers and nurses listening to music that was about to change North Americans’ tastes and grooving on the vibe of hearing it first. "
      p7: "When a city is a music city, there are opportunities for musicians to work, places where they can play, professionals who can nurture their talent and introduce them to the world and, most importantly, audiences who want the music, and then want more. Music cities are places in which people, even if they’re not musicians, want to live. "
      p8: "In 2020, we ignore that imperative at our peril. The 25-year-old who graduates today from schools around the world with in-demand skills can live anywhere. They’ll want to live in cities that are exciting, progressive and that offer the opportunity to enjoy music that is new and inventive and fresh. "
      p9: "In the nation’s capital, we are blessed to not only have some of the world’s pre-eminent music festivals and a population large enough to attract the biggest acts, but we have the talent here at home to develop something uniquely Ottawa. From urban forms to classical to jazz to singer/song-writer to country there are musical collaborations and scenes and the promise of something exciting just around the corner. Ottawa is increasingly a city of immigrants, from within the country and without, and with a deliberately inclusive and generous approach, our musicians are very much poised to give audiences the experiences they crave. "
      p10: "In 2017, Ottawa’s City Council adopted a music strategy that has seen us encourage where we can the creation and enjoyment of music. We’ve worked hard to embrace new venues, remove red tape, and encourage artists to study, create and play music. The train’s big wheels keep turning, and new cars keep getting coupled to it. It’s only a matter of time and generosity and perseverance before Ottawa’s carriage gets hooked up. When it does, I want to be at the station so it doesn’t leave without me. "

    article:
      p1: "What is the significance of chamber music in the midst of an international pandemic? In a world where we have had to define who is “essential” and, by contrast, who is “non-essential,” where do musicians and arts workers fall along this somewhat polarizing spectrum? A few minutes spent scrolling through Twitter or any social media platform would leave you thinking that it is almost criminal to call the arts non-essential at a time like this. One of the main arguments you will see is something along the lines of this: “What are you doing to pass the time in isolation? Netflix? Live-streamed concerts? Reading? Drawing? If it wasn’t for the arts, you would be bored out of your mind and isolation would be intolerable! How dare you call us non-essential!” It’s a fair argument. However, as Maslow’s Hierarchy so plainly shows us, this argument is only valid once our basic needs are taken care of: namely our physiological needs and safety needs. In an unprecedented time like this, it is absolutely vital that we respect our most basic needs as a society (in this case our incredibly dedicated front-line workers in health care, food supply, and other essential industries) while also respecting the importance and impact of the arts in our daily lives.  "
      p2: "This brings us back to the initial question: what is the significance of chamber music in the midst of an international pandemic?  "
      p3: "Chamber music is music written to be performed by small ensembles, generally without a conductor. That is not to say there is no leader, but rather than one all-important decision-making conductor (let’s not get into the topic of the state of dictatorships around the world right now…), in chamber music we all take turns leading and following. Ideally, there should be no hierarchy between the musicians’ ability to make suggestions and decisions, but rather it is a group effort. In other words, you learn quickly to compromise and make decisions for the benefit of the entire group rather than just yourself. For a simple example: if the violinist in a piano trio has a particularly difficult passage with a big expressive shift, they may want an extra bit of time to make the shift as expressive as possible, and as a result the other musicians should accommodate the time needed. If you’re lucky, all three musicians agree that this extra time makes technical and musical sense. Realistically though, there will be a discussion. Perhaps the piano has many quick notes when the extra time needs to happen, making it awkward to play, or the cellist feels that the phrase should continue moving towards a different climax rather than this particular note. All perspectives are fair and should be shared, but if this moment prominently features the violin and the other two instruments are playing supporting roles, and most importantly, if the extra time sounds good, then a decision is made to follow the current leader. Occasionally, following a different suggestion yields a different and surprisingly successful result. The result? A musically cohesive and satisfying moment for the most important people in the room: the audience.  "
      p4: "It is rare in a chamber ensemble to have three, four, or more members that all have the same backgrounds and the same perspectives of the world. Much more likely is that you will each bring your own unique and diverse experiences, expertise, and opinions into a group that must work together to create a unified vision. Nobody wants to pay for a ticket to watch a group with three members that play as if they are the only person in the room (or maybe that would make for a very interesting and exciting concert!). The best chamber groups in the world are universally praised for their unified interpretation, the fact that it’s like one entity playing the music rather than a group of individuals, and that the interaction between musicians is so natural and powerful that it can be felt from every member of the audience during a performance. "
      p5: "Performing classical music is akin to a puzzle in need of solving. The notes on the page are the same for everybody, but to achieve artistic success it requires a diverse team of experts, with ample experience and creative ideas, to come up with a unique approach, workshop those ideas, and turn it into something beautiful that everyone can agree on and present it for the world to enjoy. It is not dissimilar from trying to solve the problem of a mystery virus that spreads throughout the world. You need a team of experts to identify the problem and work together using their expertise and experience to determine the most effective way to contain and eventually eliminate the virus. Luckily for classical music, you don’t need months and years to test the efficacy of your solution to the music; you get the feedback right away from the audience. "
      p6: "There is so much to learn from chamber music (and the arts in general) in the midst of a pandemic: teamwork, respect, how to lead, how to follow, knowing when to lead and when to follow, and working towards a goal as one for the benefit of the greater good. Perhaps chamber music and the arts are essential right now, but not for the reasons that immediately come to mind. Perhaps these lessons and values that chamber music teaches us can ultimately guide us through these difficult times. As members of the Bedford Trio, a classical piano trio, these months of isolation and not performing together have given us time to reflect on these values, which are critical in both our jobs as musicians and for our well-being as a society. "
      p7: "The Bedford Trio is a Toronto-based piano trio that was formed in 2016 at the University of Toronto. Violinist Alessia Disimino, a Master of Music in Performance student at the time, was giving a recital with pianist Jialiang Zhu, who had recently started in the Doctor of Musical Arts program. I (cellist Andrew Ascenzo) was also a student in the Doctor of Musical Arts program at the time and had met Alessia many years prior at a summer festival. Jialiang and I were classmates. I attended this recital and was so enthralled the duo’s performance that I asked if they would be willing to form a piano trio. Since then, our trio has had great success in Toronto and has ventured into other areas of Ontario and the world. For the past two years, we have been the Irene R. Miller Piano Trio in Residency at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Music, finalists at the Anton Rubinstein International Chamber Music Competition in Germany, semi-finalists at the Plowman International Chamber Music Competition in Missouri, and competed in the live round of the Fischoff International Chamber Music Competition in Indiana. We were participants in the Career Development Residency at Ottawa Chamberfest, and were grateful to collaborate with composer Rob Kapilow as well as perform in Ottawa with XENIA Concerts, Concerts in Care, and in recital at Chamberfest. "
      p8: "As it became clear that the trio would live beyond our time as students at U of T and into the professional realm, the bond between the three of us strengthened. We became wonderful friends as well as professional colleagues. We got to know more about each others’ backgrounds, world views, families, faith traditions, hobbies, and interests. We grew to learn that we are similar in many ways, but also quite different in others. Most importantly, we have grown to love and respect each other’s uniqueness and what each of us bring to the group as musicians and as people. We have learned how to be a team. We have learned how to learn from each other. Chamber music has taught us as much about our lives and values as it has about music.  "
      p9: "Though we have been separated by the onset of COVID19, we remain dedicated to our craft and to our group. We are thrilled to be able to use this opportunity to introduce ourselves to you and hope you enjoy getting to know us better as musicians and as people. Our playlist will feature music that has influenced each of us individually and as a trio. "

      p1: "Music is vital for each of us. It’s a way that I have been able to connect with myself, with the world-past and present, and with others around me, including those with whom I make music, and those who hear me perform. Music is never in isolation. Music is meant to connect. To connect us with ourselves, to connect us to what is transcendent, to that which we cannot put into words and exists in the core of ourselves, and to the community and world. I feel a great privilege to have such an incredible profession and calling. Especially in this time of pause during the pandemic, it’s impossible not to notice how music has been, and will continue to be, vital to our lives, enriching our existence and ourselves.  "
      p2: "I have always been drawn to the arts. Violin was my first love (at the age of 2.5 I started playing the violin, and have never stopped!), but visual art, poetry, and prose have all been influential to me as well. I often see and hear music in an abstract way; a combination of colours, textures, undertones, shades, emotions, tones, meanings. All of these things, along with historical context, help me understand the piece I’m working on and help me determine an interpretation that feels right to me.  "
      p3: "To be a successful musician today, one has to be an artist with many skills. Naturally, honing the skill of playing an instrument itself, but also research, marketing, networking, social media, business, creativity, and ingenuity. All of these skills are important in order to be a successful musician in our day and age.  "
      p4: "The isolation caused by COVID19 has been difficult, but there have been many things that I have also been enjoying during this time. It’s been wonderful to explore more recording projects, especially with and for those in my community. The lack of live performances is definitely difficult and a hard reality for now, but I’m hopeful that this will only create more meaningful connections and performances when live music returns.  "
      p5: "There is so much coming - Bedford Trio will continue to make remote recordings, I will be recording some cover songs on the violin with two fabulous vocalist friends and colleagues of mine celebrating our Italian heritage, and many concerts are being planned for the coming 2020/2021 year (fingers crossed that these will be live!)."

While attending high school, I discovered many other genres of music, such as jazz, samba, bossa nova, and film music, all of which opened my eyes and ears even wider. Playing chamber music is one of the greatest joys in the world to me, and I am ever grateful to have met Alessia and Andrew, and to have formed our little union.

One could refer to them as the “Golden Duo” as they have created so many stunning works together over the past few decades. The opening music from the film depicts a vast landscape, which has been polluted by human activity and tragically ruined due to their battles with the nature world. The film was released in 1984 and the subject matter remains relevant to this day. I am not only touched by the story, the characters, and the music, but I also feel the responsibility we have to reduce harm to Mother Earth through our daily actions.  "

Composer Zhang Zhao has studied both Chinese local drama and Western classical music.

The lyrics, coupled with the powerful music-making of so many extremely talented artists and the variety of energy and rhythmic vitality stuck me immediately. I play this song in moments when things get overwhelming or when I am feeling good. Later, I learned that Imagine is originally by John Lennon and came to admire his version very much too. The power message in Lennon’s lyrics is one of the main reasons that this song has been one of the most covered songs of all time. "

      title: "Andrew Ascenzo, cello "
      p1: "Throughout my entire life, I have had an enormous variety of musical interests and influences. I received my first 1/8 size cello at the age of three and started lessons shortly after. Classical music was a constant in my house growing up, whether it was my father listening to a new recording of an opera or symphony that he just bought, my mother helping me practice the cello when I was very young, or my brothers, both of whom were relatively advanced pianists by the time I started playing the cello. "
      p2: "There is a significant age gap between me and my brothers (10 and 11 years, respectively), so I had the pleasure of a lot of second-hand listening when I was a young child. Queen, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, NWA, Wu-Tang Clan, Nirvana, Motley Crüe…you name it. I didn’t like most of it at the time (not surprising, given that I was about 5 years old) but over time I grew to love it all as much as any other music in my life. Music that you grow up with has this incredibly ability to associate itself with wonderful (and sometimes not so wonderful) memories. I was lucky to have a very rich and fulfilling childhood and most of this music is associated with those wonderful childhood years. As a young teenager I took an interest in jazz; particularly guitarist and vocalist John Pizzarelli and the great crooners like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Bing Crosby. In high school I thought it was my life’s mission to become a famous drummer, so I would listen day and night to John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Keith Moon (The Who), Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, Neil Peart (Rush), and really anything drum related. I turned seventeen as I began my undergraduate degree in music at U of T, and the next six years were filled almost exclusively with classical music. Years later, I went back to U of T as a doctoral student and recently graduated with a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, with research based in contemporary repertoire for solo cello and electronics. Throughout my degree, I was the musical director for several theatre shows including <i>West Side Story, South Pacific, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, 9 to 5: The Musical</i>, and <i>Mamma Mia</i>! As you can imagine, it’s extremely hard to pick fifteen minutes’ worth of music to make up a playlist of my musical influences! "

        p1: "I must have listened to this song over 1,000 times in high school, trying to recreate every single note that John Bonham played on the drums. I was obsessed with recreating his sound and technique. I watched every Led Zeppelin video I could get my hands on. Somehow my parents let me buy a drum set, though they did soundproof a room in the back of the basement shortly after the drums arrived at the house… "
        s2: "<i>Cello Concerto in E minor, I: Adagio-Moderato, Edward Elgar (Yo-Yo Ma) </i>"
        p2: "I remember the first time I heard this piece. I was in the backseat of the car, ten years old, completely enthralled by Yo-Yo’s sound. At my next lesson, I said to my teacher: “The next piece I want to learn is the Elgar concert,” which I’m sure was greeted with a great big eye-roll. Maybe it wasn’t the best pedagogical decision for me at the time, but I can tell you that I was the happiest kid in the world when I got to play those powerful chords for the first time.  "
        s3: "<i>Dream, John Pizzarelli  </i>"
        p3: "I don’t know how many times I’ve listened to this song. I discovered John Pizzarelli at age twelve and he quickly became my favourite jazz musician. I’ve since had the opportunity to see him live many, many times and meet him a couple of times. If I’m not working on Sunday morning then I’m at home, sitting in the sun room with a cup of coffee and listening to John’s show Radio Deluxe on JazzFM with his wife, vocalist Jessica Molaskey. This is the first track on his album Our Love is Here to Stay, the first record of his that I bought.  "

The album consists of some of the most loved compositions of the romantic era, and the final piece is an arrangement of J. S. Bach’s composition by the Dutch pianist, Egon Petri. The album is really a nostalgic exploration of repertoire that is very dear to me. It pushed me out of my comfort zone but I’m so happy to have this album to continue sharing my music with the world. "
      a_2: "I’ve discovered my own voice and sound and Reflections captures that, perfectly. "
      a_3: My second album that was done with Michael Curtis Hanna, Roxanne Goodman and the John Dapaah Trio was released this last Christmas. It’s called  <i><b>"Have yourself a Jazzy Little Christmas"</b></i> and is also available on my site!
    q3:
      q: "What role does music play in your life as a performer and a listener?"
      a_1: "Music plays a huge role in every aspect of my life. There's always some kind of music playing at my house - whether we're having a family dance session, doing some work, or just hanging out. As a performer it's how I express myself and hopefully uplift my audiences through my performances. "
      a_2: "Music has always been an outlet for me to express myself, so I hope to keep reaching people who feel unheard through song. I want to connect with those who feel voiceless, marginalized or invisible and provide an outlet for them to escape to or be comforted by. "
    q4:
      q: "Tell us about a favourite performance of yours "
      a_1: "During the Christmas season of 2018, my family and I went to visit my cousin and her family in New Jersey. While there we went to the Smoke Jazz Club in Manhattan (NY) for dinner and a show. After the house band finished their set, they invited other musicians to come jam with them. My cousin's husband volunteered me as I was reluctant. "
      a_2: "That ended up being one of the highlights of the trip and also one of my favourite (unexpected) performances. "
    q5:
      q: "Why did you choose the playlist you did? Are there any songs that stand out to you as an inspiration or have any interesting stories behind them? "
      a_1: "<i>Florence Price - Piano Sonata in E minor </i>"
      a_2: "I discovered Florence Price and her compositions only a few years ago. It was refreshing to learn of the many compositions by people of color in a genre that is not always inclusive of black performers and composers. I got my hands on the score and started working through it. I was invited to play in the first ever International Florence Price Festival which was to take place in Washington this August and I was hoping to perform this Sonata. Of course, the plans were changed due to COVID-19. I look forward to being a part of this in the near future. "
      a_3: "<i>PJ Morton ft. Yebba - How Deep is Your Love </i>"
      a_4: "I came across PJ a couple of years ago while browsing YouTube. I have been a fan ever since. My wife and I went to see him live at the Montreal Jazz festival last summer. It was an unforgettable experience. "
      a_5: "<i>SIMI – Duduke </i>"
      a_6: "My daughter and I have morning dance sessions on most days while making breakfast. This song is one of our favourites and is a part of the dance set. "
      a_7: "<i>Jacob Collier - It Don't Matter </i>"
      a_8: "This record just grooves. Period. "
      a_9: "<i>Rachmaninoff - Sonata for Cello and Piano (3rd mov't) </i>"
      a_10: "I played this piece with Raphael Weinroth-Browne (an amazing Ottawa cellist and composer) in my concert series Studio Sessions last year. This composition is one of my favourite works for chamber music. "
      a_11: "<i>Israel Houghton ft. Elevation Worship - Do it again & Alpha and Omega </i>"
      a_12: "I'm a believer in Jesus Christ and this is one worship song that I've been listening to lately. "
    q6:
      q: "What is the message you want this music to leave with readers/listeners? "
      a_1: "Everything is going to be alright. Stay positive, be kind, take care of yourselves and loved ones. Finally, let loose and have a dance session (or two) everyday :) "
      a_2: "And for those who are interested, I'm doing a live stream concert this Saturday afternoon, August 8th, with Michael Anthony Hanna through my Facebook Page: <a href='http://www.facebook.com/JohnKofiDapaah' target='_blank'>http://www.facebook.com/JohnKofiDapaah</a>.

    article1: "After an 8-month hiatus, orchestra musicians and community players are back with Pops at the Gladstone, a 6 week chamber music concert series. "
    p1: "To maintain and continue bringing people together through music, and to engage its musicians, the Ottawa Pops Orchestra, in partnership with <a href='https://www.thegladstone.ca/' style='color: #6a66a4' target='_blank'>The Gladstone Theatre</a>, is thrilled to offer a series of 6 weekly 30-45 minute virtual musical showcases. Small chamber ensembles made up of our orchestra members and community guests will be featured online starting December 4, 2020. "

    body:
      p1: "Crowds gather in close quarters at the concession counter; a group of teenagers arrives dressed to the nines for what is to be their first outing at the opera; the lights of the lobby blink ushering the guests to their sets; indistinct chattering can be heard as friends greet each other, while an elderly couple riffles through program notes. An announcement is made and the lights dim as a musician walks on the stage. It does not seem so long ago that we could meet by the hundreds, sometimes by the thousands in a concert hall. The live performance landscape is changing and we must adapt and face those challenges head on."
      p2: "As the situation continues to evolve, it is still uncertain when it will be safe to return to regular orchestral programming on the mainstage. It became clear rather quickly that alternative options to in-person performances would require exploring. Leveraging digital platforms as a transitory performance space all the while exploring different methods to share music with our audiences that can foster engagement, further accessibility, and ensure continued activity while further guidance is pending on live productions."
      p3: "In march we launched a short series of <i>Music Matinees</i> which features noontime performances from the homes of our musicians. After further consideration and great discussion, we are happy to announce a new partnership with Ottawa’s busiest Indie Theatre venue, The Gladstone Theatre. This partnership will allow us to present a chamber music series weekly up until the new year!"
      p4: "Concerts will include selections of classical chamber works, jazz, musical theatre, film music, holiday classics; and will feature OPO musicians as well as performing guests from the Ottawa music community. These 30-45 minute concerts will appear on the Ottawa Pops Orchestra’s Facebook page, premiering at 7pm every Friday evening, with the exception of our Holiday Classics concert which will be presented at 7pm on December 24th. Every concert will be filmed at The Gladstone Theatre, our presenting partner, and we are incredibly grateful to use the space for this virtual concert series! "

      p: In this program featuring the music of Mozart and Brahms, we find ourselves in an ancient forest grove contemplating the timelessness of these works. Mozart’s formal structures in perfect sonata form open this concert, giving way to the music of Brahms combining styles of the past and present by setting rich harmonies and emotionally dramatic music to formal structures. Finally, Brahms’s Horn Trio magnifies the merging of the abstract and the elemental abandoning elaborate rhetoric for a more linear, logical procession of ideas all the while calling out from a place of unexamined instinct, stirred by familial love and loss.
