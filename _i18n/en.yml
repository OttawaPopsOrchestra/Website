  mission: The Ottawa Pops Orchestra aims to foster the next generation of musicians, redefine the orchestral experience, and create a sense of community in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region.
  about:
    one: We are a young, semi-professional orchestra dedicated to performing accessible and relevant music. The “Pops” in our name is short for “popular” as the music we play is sourced from current popular culture, telling stories from once upon a time in galaxies far, far away. That said, we also like to keep one foot in the world of classical music – its traditions, its rich history, and especially its romance.
    two: We combine our passions by performing innovative concerts that redefine the modern orchestral experience. We’re made of people just like you, and we love to dress up and share our love for the music we play. Our mission - to foster the next generation of musicians, redefine the orchestral experience, and create a sense of community in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region.
    three: We have humble roots as a school club at the University of Ottawa, starting in 2012 with only a handful of eager musicians. After five years, we split from the university and ventured into the real world, this time with a sixty-person orchestra and a full administrative team.
    four: Our first season in 2017-2018 was a huge success, as we performed for over 3000 people over the course of three series of concerts. In the 2018-2019 season, our performances are hosted exclusively at Meridian Theatres at Centrepointe as we develop educational opportunities in the Ottawa area and bring bigger and better shows to life than ever before.
