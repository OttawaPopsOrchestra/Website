  mission-title: Our Mission
  mission: The Ottawa Pops Orchestra aims to foster the next generation of musicians, redefine the orchestral experience, and create a sense of community in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region.
  about:
    one: We are a semi-professional community orchestra dedicated to performing accessible and relevant music. The “Pops” in our name is short for “popular” as the music we play is sourced from current popular culture, telling stories from once upon a time in galaxies far, far away. That said, we also like to keep one foot in the world of classical music – its traditions, its rich history, and especially its romance.
    two: We combine our passions by performing innovative concerts that redefine the modern orchestral experience. We’re made of people just like you, and we love to dress up and share our love for the music we play. Our mission - to foster the next generation of musicians, redefine the orchestral experience, and create a sense of community in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region.
    three: We have humble roots as a school club at the University of Ottawa, founded by Mathieu Roy in 2012 with only a handful of eager musicians. We have since incorporated as a Non Profit Organization and boast 65 musicians.
    four: Our first season in 2017-2018 was a huge success, as we performed for over 3000 people over the course of three series of concerts. In the 2018-2019 season, our performances are hosted exclusively at Meridian Theatres at Centrepointe as we develop educational opportunities in the Ottawa area and bring bigger and better shows to life than ever before.

about-us:
  title: Learn about the Ottawa Pops Orchestra
  one: The Ottawa Pops Orchestra is a community orchestra dedicated to programming orchestral pops repertoire in order to enrich and inspire the community through accessible, relevant, and passionate performances.
  two: Founded in the spring of 2017 by a collective of young musicians, Ottawa Pops Orchestra (OPO) strives to bridge classical orchestral repertoire with popular music, curating innovative concerts that redefine the orchestral experience for today’s audience. Under the joint direction of Matthew Larkin and Jonathan Dagenais, OPO strives to inspire, engage, and educate the greater Ottawa/Gatineau area.
  three: OPO is proud to announce two new educational initiatives for young musicians and students in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region. We are inviting local schools to some of our dress rehearsals and providing detailed educational resources for those shows to teachers, allowing students to experience a live orchestra in action. This season, we are also proud to offer the Orchestral Development Bursary, which provides the opportunity for young, talented musicians to refine their skill and gain professional orchestral experience with OPO.

season:
  covid: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to postpone the 2020-21 season announcement to a later time. More information to come.

    fastFacts:
      title: "Fast Facts for Twin Flames"
      f1: "Twin Flames is an award-winning husband-and-wife duo. Jaaji and Chelsey June sing songs in English, Inuttitut and French. "
      f2: "Jaaji is Inuk and Mohawk from Nunavik and Chelsey June métis (Algonquin Cree) from Ottawa. "
      f3: "Twin Flames push the boundaries of “Contemporary Folk”, with songs that incorporate both Western and traditional instruments. "
      f4: "Winners 2016 and 2017 of The Canadian Folk Music Award; Aboriginal Songwriters of the year."
      f5: "Human hit #1 on indigenous music charts, CBC’s Music Class, and was the UNESCO feature song to celebrate indigenous languages around the world "
      f6: "This piece has been translated into 500 languages across the world"
      f7: "Twin Flames is working on a brand new album called Omen, which will be released this August "
    q1:
      q: "Why did you choose these songs? Is there a greater, unifying context to the playlist? "
      a_1: "Chelsey: “Definitely. All of the songs we chose are ones that influenced our life, our music writing and our musical career. The playlist is pretty much a walkthrough of how Twin Flames was born from the very beginning. We first met in 2014 on the television series, TAM (Talent Autochtones Musicaux), and our instant connection through music. Neither of us were supposed to be there on set, but with Jaaji’s last minute tour schedule change and me getting there through a cancellation, we ended up there on the same day.” "
      a_2: "Jaaji: “Everyone was singing around the fire after filming, and Chelsey started jamming with me on one of my cover songs. When our voices met in harmony, everyone noticed how much we clicked through song. Usually, harmonizing is something you practice and learn with your band, but this was instantaneous. Having grown up with the great harmonies of yesterday in my ear, it was a very impacting moment between us and where it all began.” "
    q2:
      q: "How have these songs/pieces impacted you? "
      a_1: "Chelsey: “All of these pieces tie into our life and how we were feeling at the time, so it’s kind of a journey through our life experiences. It’s hard to choose, but there are a few special pieces that stand out. Yellow by Coldplay, influenced both of us deeply. I remember being so in awe of the sounds in the song.” "
      a_2: "Jaaji: “I totally agree. The piece is acoustic and simple, but still so full of nuance. It’s simple but incredibly inspiring at the same time.” "
      a_3: "Chelsey: “ A lot of my musical influences come from my subconscious, and my parents were both obsessed with music. I vividly remember listening to Leaving on a Jet Plane by John Denver, sitting on the floor with those huge 80s headphones. Music was a different level of love for me, as I grew up in a household as an only child, and watching a difficult relationship between my parents. Music was an escape for me for sure, and I think I learned that from my mom. I remember her blasting Coming Around Again by Calry Simon, which talks about marriage and babies and how hard it can get on a relationship when the couple isn’t the focus. I loved the melody of the song, but now the lyrics are really impacting because I understand them as an adult. It was so fun to do this exercise, to dig down and realize what we think about this music and how it impacted us.” "
      a_4: "Jaaji: “For me, being from an era when CDs were just coming out, I remember my stepdad was the first guy to get a CD player way up north, and it was a big deal. I grew up listening to all the folk greats like Simon and Garfunkel, but I was often listening to the cover versions from alternative rock bands. Honestly, it was a bit of an emotional can of worms opening up, looking back at the past and listening to this music and then  seeing/feeling how it influenced the writing we have now with our pieces. Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours was a big one. It’s really cool to see the musical influences on our new album which is coming out in August.” "
      a_5: "Chelsey: “This music is definitely personal to us. Especially the pieces that we wrote or Jaaji wrote before Twin Flames. Nunaga was the first song she heard Jaaji singing on the set for TAM. I didn’t understand the language but I was totally captivated by it. So much so that I would drive to work listening to that song. It’s really special that we now sing it together.” "
      a_6: "Jaaji: “Ya, this piece has become an anthem for the north. I wrote it in 2010 during a dark time when my son had been hospitalized for an accident. I remember sitting in the hospital and desperately wanting to go back to my innocence and youth, to go back home where I grew up, way up north in the Arctic. Suddenly, I saw these snowflakes falling outside like they did during my childhood, and I hadn’t seen any snowflakes that size anywhere else but home in the north. I got nostalgic, picked up my mandolin, went to the washroom and created Nunaga. Lots of art happens in the washroom, to be honest. But I sang from my heart, and wrote the words on a scrap of paper and not a single part of the lyrics or the melody changed. People love this song for its relatability and nostalgia. We’ve played it eight times in one night.” "
      a_7: "Chelsey: “Another piece that we created together on this playlist is Whispers in the Dark. Before we performed together, I was working a government job and was so unhappy. Jaaji finally convinced me to come on tour with him, but I was scared of performing, of planes… of my own shadow. But I joined him touring for the summer of 2015, exclusively touring through the Arctic. It wasn’t instantly perfect by any means. I was dealing with social anxiety and the reception to me, as a white-looking indigenous woman that no one know, onstage with Jaaji, who was a musical idol, it was tough. People didn’t want me up there at first. So when I got home to Ottawa, Jaaji and I wrote this call-and-answer style piece, Whispers in the Dark, which is all about how neither of us are alone because we have each other.” "
      a_8: "Jaaji: “It’s also a huge testament to Chelsey and her huge heart that she hung in there. She kept pushing and eventually the reception shifted to love. She is now known as the ‘inlaw to the north’ which is _______ in Inuttutit. I loved growing Twin Flames with her. Even in the beginning, Chelsey had this playlist that was different to what I normally listened to. She loved The Civil Wars and they sounded like they were a couple. Their song Dust to Dust had lyrics that fit like, ‘let me hold your hand, we can dance around the flame / you’re like a mirror reflecting me, takes one to know one so take it from me’  It was great to think we could share this dream together, too.” "
      a_9: "Chelsey: “Sharing the dream together always makes us go, ‘as if we get to live this, as if we are lucky enough to experience this’. We have experienced some amazing moments with fellow artists, too. We have Chosen by Rose Cousins on our playlist because we met her during the Canada C3 reparation talks. We were chosen to perform for the full camp and that’s where we met Rose. We felt transported, and I felt that every word of her songs were chosen for me. I got to meet her again at the Edmonton folk festival, and she brought me up to jam. Jaaji is all about the melody but I find I am more drawn to lyrics. "
      a_10: "Jaaji: “I definitely connect with the melody but there are lyrics that really hit home for me, too. Porchlight from our first debut album was never supposed to be ‘out there’ it was really a song for us to cope with the issues around the missing and murdered indigenous women of Canada and then the song just became so important to us and our audience. "
      a_11: "Chelsey: “For me, I grew up off the reserve and while I was told as a child to be proud of my Métis culture but I didn’t know what that meant. My mom was even told to be afraid to talk about her Métis background. Rediscovering my culture through my adolescence and adult life has been so important.” "
    q3:
      q: "What story does your music tell and what do you want it to make people feel? "
      a_1: "Chelsey: “We want our music to help audiences within communities to feel proud and that they have a voice in this world. As an indigenous woman, I want to use my voice to bring about change and understanding in non-indigenous communities. We want to make the conversation around reconciliation and understanding, accessible. We don’t want people to feel guilty or that they need to apologize, but we want to encounter our audience with open and honest hearts so we can give our brothers and sisters a voice by singing songs in their own languages, and to give non-indigenous people a deeper understand of us and of indigenous people in Canadian history, because a lot has been left out. But our main message is that the world needs a lot more love and this is always at the forefront of our music and our message. Music is the soundtrack of our entire lives, and we’re just so glad people are listening, especially our youths.” "
      a_2: "Jaaji: “Absolutely. Our hope is always that maybe they’ll turn on the song and realize that they can do anything with their lives and that nothing is impossible. The outlets are there, music, sports, poetry, hunting… We just want to encourage our listeners to follow their dreams. I became a cop when I got out of high school because I needed to support my child, I never thought I would be a musician but it happened. But in our communities and our world, there is a huge need to encourage people to follow their dreams, especially our youth. I have a younger brother and many friends that have committed suicide, and we are desperate for this epidemic to stop and for our youth to see how much they can accomplish. We get mail from fans saying ‘your song saved my life, I was ready to go but there was a kid outside the shed playing one of your songs, and I didn’t follow through’. Getting that kind of a message gives us so much joy, but we’ve gotten messages from people saying thank you for the music, but they can’t go on living. One life lost is too many, so we are here to tell people they matter and can achieve their dreams.” "
      a_3: "Chelsey: “Absolutely. I remember my own feelings of singing alone and only to myself. At 26, I finally decided to try song writing, just for me. And then when I started making an album, I was only doing it to show my children that they could do anything they wanted, ‘if mommy can do it, you guys can do it’. From doing my first recording session, where I had to face away from the tech team because I was so nervous, to finally being onstage and seeing the audience sing my own songs back with me, it was surreal. I realized I could connect with people and share my voice with them. Having Jaaji onstage was that extra security blanket, and a wonderful team of musicians and an incredible producer… We’ve just been so lucky. And we want to use that to show people that they can follow and work for their dreams, too.” "
    q4:
      q: "Is there a message you want to convey to your readers/listeners? "
      a_1: "Jaaji: “A lot of people pay too much attention to what they should or shouldn’t be listening to instead of making their own choice. We’ve all grown up with all kinds of music in those cd rack card holders and it’s okay to like what you like! I don’t ever expect anyone to like our music, if they don’t, good for the next band that they do like. It’s okay to love what you love, music is so important and deserves to be something to enjoy and escape to.” "
      a_2: "Chelsey: “To anyone who discovers our music for the first time, we hope that they listen with an open heart, and want to learn more about our stories… not just ours but the whole history of our people. Also, our stories that dreams do come true and you can work for your dreams. We really would love to be featured on a commercial singing in English and Inuttitut, we know there is space for it here in Canada.” "
      a_3: "Both: “And finally, that art is important! Everyone has been listening to music and watching shows created and recorded by artists. It isn’t non-essential, and when we have so many big corporations asking us to play for free or for ‘exposure’, it doesn’t make sense that we are ‘essential’ to making their company meeting or fundraiser a success, but we are considered non-essential when it comes to money. Art is so important, so keep listening, watching and supporting artists!” "
